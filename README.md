# Network-Vis Backend

This is a backend for a network visualiser using Neo4J to store the network graph. The networks that are visualised are networks of Steam Accounts.

DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a finished backend and is NOT product ready. Many things will probably change in the future. Some parts might be moved out into their own repository and packages in the future.

## Feature List

- Query Network
- Add Accounts and Networks to the database
- Wrapper for Neo4J-Driver and a custom Cypher-Builder with a Fluent API
  - Note: This might be moved to its own repository with its own packages in the future.
